  abstract = {The average globular protein contains 30\% $\alpha$-helix, the most common type of secondary structure. Some amino acids occur more frequently in $\alpha$-helices than others; this tendency is known as helix propensity. Here we derive a helix propensity scale for solvent-exposed residues in the middle positions of $\alpha$-helices. The scale is based on measurements of helix propensity in 11 systems, including both proteins and peptides. Alanine has the highest helix propensity, and, excluding proline, glycine has the lowest, $\sim$1kcal/mol less favorable than alanine. Based on our analysis, the helix propensities of the amino acids are as follows (kcal/mol): Ala=0, Leu=0.21, Arg=0.21, Met=0.24, Lys=0.26, Gln=0.39, Glu=0.40, Ile=0.41, Trp=0.49, Ser=0.50, Tyr=0.53, Phe=0.54, Val=0.61, His=0.61, Asn=0.65, Thr=0.66, Cys=0.68, Asp=0.69, and Gly=1.},

  abstract = {The molecular structures of all gold mono- and trihalides and of their dimers have been calculated at the B3LYP, MP2, and CCSD(T) levels of theory by using relativistic pseudopotentials for all atoms except fluorine. Our computations support the experimental observation that the relative stability of the monohalides increases from the fluoride toward the iodide, while the stability trend of the trihalides is the opposite. The potential energy surface (PES) of all gold trihalides has been investigated. These molecules are typical Jahn-Teller systems; the trigonal planar D3h-symmetry geometry does not correspond to the minimum energy structure for any of them. At the same time, the amount and character of their Jahn-Teller distortion changes gradually from AuF3 to AuI3. The minimum energy geometry is a T-shaped structure for AuF3 and AuCl3, with a Y-shaped transition-state structure. For AuI3, the Y-shaped structure lies lower than the T-shaped structure on the PES. For AuBr3 and AuI3, neither of them is the global minimum but instead an L-shaped structure, which lies outside the Jahn-Teller PES. This structure can be considered to be a donor-acceptor system, or a closed-shell interaction, with I2 acting as donor and AuI as acceptor. The dimers of gold monohalides have very short gold-gold distances and demonstrate the aurophilic interaction. The dimers of the trihalides are planar molecules with two bridging halogen atoms.},

  abstract = {The stability of gold iodides in the oxidation state +I and +III is investigated at the ab initio and density functional level using relativistic and nonrelativistic energy-adjusted pseudopotentials for gold and iodine. The calculations reveal that relativistic effects stabilize the higher oxidation state of gold as expected, that is Au2I6 is thermodynamically stable at the relativistic level, whilst at the nonrelativistic level the complex of two iodine molecules weakly bound to both gold atoms in Au2I2 is energetically preferred. The rather low stability of AuI3 with respect to dissociation into AuI and I2 will make it difficult to isolate this species in the solid state as (possibly) Au2I6 or detect it by matrix-isolation techniques. The monomer AuI3 is Jahn-Teller distorted from the ideal trigonal planar (D3h) form, but adopts a Y-shaped structure (in contrast to AuF3 and AuCl3), and in the nonrelativistic case can be described as I2 weakly bound to AuI. Relativistic effects turn AuI3 from a static Jahn-Teller system to a dynamic one. For the yet undetected gas-phase species AuI accurate coupled-cluster calculations for the potential energy curve are used to predict vibrational-rotational constants. Solid-state density functional calculations are performed for AuI and Au2I6 in order to predict cohesive energies.},

Probing the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the densest packings is a problem of interest in discrete geometry and number theory. Previous work has focused mainly on spherical particles\textemdash{}very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. Here we formulate the generation of dense packings of polyhedra as an optimization problem, using an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions (we term this the 'adaptive shrinking cell' scheme). Using a variety of multi-particle initial configurations, we find the densest known packings of the four non-tiling Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The densities are 0.782, 0.947, 0.904... and 0.836..., respectively. Unlike the densest tetrahedral packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Combining our simulation results with derived rigorous upper bounds and theoretical arguments leads us to the conjecture that the densest packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings. This is the analogue of Kepler's sphere conjecture for these solids.},

Both simulation methods, when tested for Lennard-Jones crystals, give accurate results of the free energy differing from each other in the fifth significant digit. The solid-solid phase transition temperature of C60 crystal is determined from free energy profiles, and found to be 260 K, which is in good agreement with experiment. For C70 crystal, using the potential model of Sprik et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 1660 (1992)], low-temperature solid-solid phase transition temperature is found to be 160\,K determined from the free energy profiles. Whereas this is somewhat lower than the experimental value, it is in agreement with conventional molecular simulations, which validates the methodological consistency of the present simulation method. From the calculations of the free energies of C60 and C70 crystals, we note the significance of symmetry number for crystal phase needed to properly account for the indistinguishability of orientationally disordered states.},

The driving force for the phase transformation of various orientational orderings is an effective contact area between C70 molecules. Phase transformation associated with orientational ordering is also discussed.},

  abstract = {An ellipsoid, the simplest nonspherical shape, has been extensively used as a model for elongated building blocks for a wide spectrum of molecular, colloidal, and granular systems. Yet the densest packing of congruent hard ellipsoids, which is intimately related to the high-density phase of many condensed matter systems, is still an open problem. We discover an unusual family of dense crystalline packings of self-dual ellipsoids (ratios of the semiaxes $\alpha$:$\surd\alpha$:1), containing 24 particles with a quasi-square-triangular (SQ-TR) tiling arrangement in the fundamental cell. The associated packing density $\phi$ exceeds that of the densest known SM2 crystal [ A. Donev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 255506 (2004)] for aspect ratios $\alpha$ in (1.365, 1.5625), attaining a maximal $\phi\approx$0.75806... at $\alpha$=93/64. We show that the SQ-TR phase derived from these dense packings is thermodynamically stable at high densities over the aforementioned $\alpha$ range and report a phase diagram for self-dual ellipsoids. The discovery of the SQ-TR crystal suggests organizing principles for nonspherical particles and self-assembly of colloidal systems.},

It involves alignment of the molecules with their long axis parallel to the original hexagonal axis, and a shift out of the original hcp positions. Intermolecular contacts are shown to be different from those found in C60. The crystal is determined to contain stacking faults resulting in the presence of AC and BC deformed hcp arrangements in addition to the original AB stacking. The stacking disorder is shown to be independent of the phase transitions, and presumably is an intrinsic property of hexagonal C70 crystals.},

At high temperatures, an orientationally disordered fcc phase is preferred over a hcp lattice. At low temperature, a triclinic phase seems to be favored by the present model, but other structures (space group Pa3, and hcp) also have very competitive potential energies. Estimates of the molecular-reorientation times are given. The librational phonon density of states has been studied.

The minimum energy configuration for the molecular orientations turns out to be at \texttheta=18$^\circ$, $\varphi$=8$^\circ$, and $\psi$=5$^\circ$, where \texttheta, $\varphi$, and $\psi$ define the molecular orientations.},

The shapes considered are oblate and prolate spheroids, with the aspect ratio varying from 0.1 to 7.0. It is shown that the predicted relationship between packing fraction and aspect ratio is consistent with those reported in the literature. Ellipsoids can pack more densely than spheres. The maximum packing fraction occurs at an aspect ratio of 0.6 for oblate spheroids, and 1.80 for prolate spheroids. The packing characteristics with aspect ratio are further analyzed in terms of structural parameters such as coordination number and radial distribution function. It is shown that ellipsoids with small or large aspect ratios tend to give a locally ordered structure. The results demonstrate that DEM provides a useful method to investigate the packing dynamics of ellipsoidal particles.},

The resolution of the experimental setup allows to examine the volume decrease dV/dp under pressure even for pressures of a tenth of a GPa. The obtained data of numerous experimental runs result in a bulk modulus of 13.4 GPa, which is much smaller than the value reported by Duclos et al. [1]. At 170 K and 70 K a bulk modulus of 14.2 GPa and 14.7 GPa was obtained, respectively. The pressure induced fcc-sc transition at 300 K was clearly visible at approx. 0.3 GPa with a jump in the lattice parameter of 0.05 \{$\backslash$AA\}. With increasing pressure we found an extreme change in dV/dp, which disables the usage of common equations of state (EOS), like the Murnaghan [2] or Birch [3] equation.

  abstract = {We characterize the molecular reorientational dynamics in two phases of solid C60 with "C NMR measurements. A change in the nature of the dynamics, indicated by a change in kinetic parameters ex-tracted from spin-lattice relaxation data, occurs at the phase transition at 260 K. Above the transition, the molecules appear to execute continuous rotational diffusion; below the transition, they appear to jump between symmetry-equivalent orientations. This interpretation is consistent with the x-ray-diffraction results of Heiney et al. as well as our NMR relaxation and spectral data. PACS numbers: 64.70.Kb, 33.25.Bn, 33.25.Dq, 61.50. \textemdash{} f The recent demonstration of a method [1] for produc-ing large quantities of solid C60 (buckminsterfullerene) has catalyzed an explosion of interest in the chemical and physical properties of this new molecular form of carbon. A variety of spectroscopic [2-7] and diffraction [8] mea-surements have confirmed the predicted truncated icosa-hedral (soccer ball) structure [9] of the C60 molecule. Even more recently, interest in the physical properties of Cqp in the solid state has received impetus from the discovery that C\&0 becomes a conductor [10] and a super-conductor [11]upon doping with alkali-metal atoms. Pure Ct,p adopts a crystal structure in which C6p mole-cules are positioned with their centers of mass on an fcc lattice [12]. ' C nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) spectra of solid C6p have shown unequivocally that indivi-dual C\&p molecules reorient rapidly and isotropically in the solid state at room temperature [5,6, 13]. This reori-entational motion shows up as orientational disorder in room-temperature x-ray-diffraction measurements [12, 14]. As expected, the NMR spectra show that the motion becomes very slow at low temperatures; i.e. , large-amplitude reorientations of C6p molecules become infrequent on the time scale of the NMR measurements. These observations lead to an important question regard-ing the structure of solid C6p at low temperatures: Do C\&p molecules order orientationally or do they form an orientational glass? One might predict an orientationally disordered (glass) structure simply because it is not im-mediately obvious how icosahedral molecules would order orientationally on an fcc lattice. Surprisingly, a recent x-ray-diffraction and calorimetry study by Heiney et al. [14] has revealed a phase transition at about 250 K in solid C\&p that they interpret as a transition to an orienta-tionally ordered low-temperature structure. This inter-pretation is particularly remarkable because the earlier NMR studies showed that rapid reorientations persist well below the reported transition temperature. In this Letter, we present ' C NMR measurements that elucidate the nature of the molecular dynamics in both phases of solid C6p. We report the temperature dependence of the ' C nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate and the},

We expect that pressurization will probe this diversity as the intermolecular distance is reduced. Here we present experimental measurements of the room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state of C60 fullerite to pressures of 20 GPa. The face-centred cubic phase remains stable under hydrostatic compression to this pressure, with an atmospheric-pressure isothermal bulk modulus of K0 = 18.1 +/- 1.8 GPa and dK0/dP = 5.7 +/- 0.6, characteristic of isotropic van der Waals intermolecular bonding. X-ray diffraction intensity changes are consistent with the compressibility of the C60 molecule being significantly lower than that of the bulk fullerite solid. Under non-hydrostatic compression, a transition to a crystallographic structure of lower symmetry is observed at 16 +/- 1 GPa.},

Using a force field developed recently for sp2 carbon atoms, we predict here the crystal structures and cohesive energies for close-packed crystals of C60 and C70. We predict, and confirm from calculations, that for C60 face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) packing is more stable than hexagonal close-packing (h.c.p.), by 0.90 kcal mol-1, whereas for C70 h.c.p. is more stable than f.c.c. by 0.35 kcal mol-1. The cubic structure of C60 undergoes an orthorhombic distortion to space group Cmca at 0 K. At higher temperatures there is rapid reorientation (but not free rotation) of C60 molecules, suggesting that above about 200 K a phase transition occurs to an orientationally disordered, f.c.c. structure (with a room-temperature lattice parameter of 14.13 angstrom). This may correspond to the first-order transition observed 4 at 249 K. The threefold axes of the C60 molecules in the low-temperature structure are not aligned with the threefold crystallographic axes.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous formation of locally ordered patterns during dewetting of thin films on homogeneous and heterogeneous substrates is investigated based on the 3-D nonlinear equation of motion. Physicochemical heterogeneities engender the rapid formation of the primary holes that serve as "seeds" for the formation of locally ordered structures. The secondary multiring structure surrounding the primary hole evolves by one of the following two different pathways depending on the film thickness vis-{\`a}-vis the location of the minimum in the spinodal curve: (A) Thick films evolve by the formation of secondary satellite holes that originate from a ring-like depression behind the rim of the primary hole. The process of ordering is repeated until the true spinodal holes appear on the remaining substrate. (B) Ordering in a relatively thin film occurs by the formation of droplets caused by the disintegration of the elevated rim that surrounds the primary hole. The radial distance between the successive ordered layers is close to the spinodal length scale, lambda(m). Droplets within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly greater than lambda(m), whereas holes within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly less than lambda(m). The number density of holes or droplets in the ordered pattern is of the same order as the predictions of the spinodal theory. The number of ordered layers and the size of the locally ordered domain depend significantly on the relative magnitudes of the time scales for the following events: (1) formation of the primary hole, (2) growth of holes (inverse of hole-growth velocity), (3) formation of a secondary feature (hole or droplet) adjacent to the primary hole, (4) true spinodal rupture far from the primary hole. The morphology of an ordered structure can therefore be tailored by modulation of the film thickness and the short- and long-range intermolecular interactions (substrate surface properties), since these affect the time scales 1 to 4 in different ways.},

The static appearance of this directly determined map, however, does not refute the notion of uncorrelated molecular positions in the crystal lattice, indicated earlier by nuclear-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and neutron scattering. Although the direct determination of crystallographic phases is correct, the occurrence of strong axial h00 reflections in the electron diffraction patterns appears to be a result of secondary scattering. Correction for this perturbation produces a good fit of the intensities to an isotropic spherical shell of C atoms. In fact, the static appearance of the initial potential map is artificial, owing to the use of only a limited set of phased structure factors in the Fourier transform carried out after the ab initio structure analysis.},

The compression of the c parameter, the interlayer distance, is typical of a weak Van der Waals interaction, whereas the compression of the a parameter indicates strong covalent interactions. Amorphization was observed to occur gradually between 10 and 29 GPa when inter- and intra-layer distances become similar. No transition to another crystalline phase was observed up to 41 GPa or on decompression. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

They yield reasonable agreement with experiment, but wave-function-based correlations methods are preferable to obtain better insight into the correlation properties. Starting from a Hartree\textendash{}Fock calculation for the solid, an incremental scheme relying on localized orbitals is developed for the correlation energy of C60. This many-body expansion converges well with distance of localized bonds involved in the correlation methods and with order of increments. A detailed knowledge of the influence of the correlation effects on the binding and the bond alternation is achieved. Comparison with diamond, graphite, and polyacetylene is made. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2004},

The twin components are equal. A given component, which has crystallographically imposed symmetry [See equation in the PDF file] displays an ordered structure of a truncated icosahedron.

Both systems are found to be elemental semiconductors having small indirect gaps. Furthermore, since the interlayer distance between adjacent polymerized planes for both phases is small, these systems are found to have three-dimensional electronic structures. From structural optimizations under the experimental lattice parameters, we reveal energetic high stabilities of these phases. In particular, the tetragonal phase is found to be considerably more stable in energy than the fcc phase. Its high stability is caused by the formation of intercluster bonds whose energy gain is larger than the energy loss due to the distortion of the carbon networks of C60 units upon polymerization.},

Although the lattice constants of this 3D polymer phase are close to those of experimentally observed values [S. Yamanaka et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 076602 (2006)], the present phase has much more sp3 C sites than the experimentally proposed phase and each C60 has interfullerene chemical bonds with all the 12 neighbor C60 fullerenes. From the subsequent total-energy electronic-structure analysis in the framework of the density-functional theory, it is found that this completely polymerized C60 phase has much lower total energy than the previously proposed 3D polymer phases and possesses the metallic electronic structure.},

We investigate the system under five pressure values, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 GPa. Under 10 and 20 GPa, sc C60 transforms into a new sc three-dimensional (3D) C60 polymer. We study the structural stability as well as the electronic properties of this sc 3D C60 polymer using the density-functional total-energy calculation with the local-density approximation, and this new sc 3D polymer phase is predicted to be highly stable. Interestingly, the lattice constant of this new sc 3D polymer phase is found to be close to those of both the face-centered-cubic (fcc) 3D phase of Yamanaka et al. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130 (2008) 4303] and that of Mezouar et al. [Phys. Rev. B 68 (2003) 193414]. In addition, the material is predicted to be a semiconductor. Moreover, it is even found from simulated structure factors for this new sc 3D polymer phase that this new sc 3D polymer phase might satisfy the extinction rule of fcc when the antiphase boundary defects exist in the crystal, indicating that this phase can be a candidate for one of main phases in the experimental samples.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the properties and phases of fullerenes and their derivatives and compounds under high pressures. For obvious reasons most of the paper deals with C60 but the materials reviewed also include C70, simple derivatives of C60, carbon nanotubes, and intercalation compounds of C60 with both acceptors and donors, mainly alkali metals. After a brief overview of high-pressure techniques and the structures and properties of C60 at atmospheric pressure, the structural phase diagram of C60 from atmospheric pressure to above 40GPa (400kbar) is reviewed. The evolution with pressure of the orientational and translational structure of 'normal' molecular C60 in the range up to 1-5GPa (depending on temperature) is discussed in some detail, as is the appearance of a large number of polymeric phases at higher pressures and temperatures, some of them known to have extreme mechanical properties. At very high static (or shock) pressures or temperatures, C60 transforms into ordered or disordered forms of diamond or graphite. The phase diagram is reasonably well investigated up to near 10GPa, but at higher pressures there are still large gaps in our knowledge. Available experimental data for the physical properties of both monomeric and polymeric C60 under high pressures are reviewed as far as possible. The compression behaviour of C60 has been well investigated and is discussed in detail because of its basic importance, but optical, electrical and lattice properties have also been studied for several of the many structural phases of C60. Whenever possible, experimental data are compared with the results of theoretical calculations. The phase diagram and properties of C70 are much less known because of the larger complexity caused by the anisotropy of the molecule, and very little is known about most compounds of C60. However, noble-gas intercalation in C60 has been reasonably well investigated. Finally, the high-pressure properties of superconducting alkali-metalintercalated C60 are briefly reviewed.},

The experimental effort consists of ion mobility measurements that lead to the assignment of the collision cross sections for the different cluster sizes at room temperature.

By comparison of the theoretical results with the measured collision cross sections as well as vertical detachment energies ?VDEs? from the literature, we assign structures for the small Aun ? ions (n?13) and locate the transition from planar to three-dimensional structures. While a unique assignment based on the observed VDEs alone is generally not possible, the collision cross sections provide a direct and rather sensitive measure of the cluster structure. In contrast to what was expected from other metal clusters and previous theoretical studies, the structural transition occurs at an unusually large cluster size of twelve atoms.},

When paired with an appropriate exchange functional, our nonlocal correlation model yields accurate interaction energies of weakly-bound complexes, not only near the energy minima but also far from equilibrium. Our model exhibits an outstanding precision at predicting equilibrium intermonomer separations in van der Waals complexes. It also gives accurate covalent bond lengths and atomization energies. Hence the functional proposed in this work is a computationally inexpensive electronic structure tool of broad applicability.},

The latter are crucially important to explain the absorption behavior and hence the color of gold. A detailed analysis of the oscillator strengths allows us to trace back the origin of the optical transitions within a given energy range to certain regions in the Brillouin zone. The four examples highlight the importance of relativistic effects that show up in different energy regimes of the optical spectra.

  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.4.3321},
  abstract = {The energy band structure of gold is calculated by the relativistic augmented-plane-wave (RAPW) method. A nonrelativistic calculation is also presented, and a comparison between this and the RAPW results demonstrates that the shifts and splittings due to relativistic effects are of the same order of magnitude as the gaps (approximately 1 eV). Various integrated functions, density of states, joint density of states, and energy distributions of joint density of states are derived from the RAPW calculation. These functions are used in an interpretation of photoemission and static reflectance measurements. It is shown that the photoemission results are extremely well described in terms of a model assuming all transitions to be direct whereas a nondirect model fails. The $\epsilon$2 profile calculated in a crude model assuming constant matrix elements matches well the corresponding experimental results. The calculated interband edge ($\hslash\omega$i=2.38 eV) agrees with experimental values, and the absorption tail below the interband edge which is found in experimental traces is also contained in the theoretical curve. By means of a calculation of the Fermi surface and the constant-energy-difference surfaces it has been possible to trace out the regions in k$\vec$ space where the edge and tail transitions occur. It is demonstrated that structure in the static reflection curves are not related to critical points in the band structure. The arguments are supported by calculations of temperature shifts of the critical-point energies and comparison to the observed temperature shifts of the elements of structure in the experimental $\epsilon$2 function. Such structure may originate in extended rather than localized regions of k$\vec$ space. In contrast, critical-point transitions show up clearly in modulated reflectance spectra, and all elements of structure are fully accounted for by our band model. The temperature and strain responses in the band structure are determined by performing the RAPW calculation with two lattice constants and estimating the effects of the lattice vibrations by means of an OPW-LCAO (linear combination of atomic orbitals) scheme with pseudopotential Fourier constants reduced by the appropriate Debye-Waller factors. The phonon spectrum has been calculated for the latter purpose.},

The pseudopotential core includes 92 electrons corresponding to the configuration [Xe]4f(14)5d(10)5f(14). The parameters for the elements 111-118 were fitted by two-component multi-configuration Hartree-Fock calculations in the intermediate coupling scheme to the total energies of 267 up to 797 J levels arising from 31 up to 62 nonrelativistic configurations, including also anionic and highly ionized states, with mean absolute errors clearly below 0.02 eV for averages corresponding to nonrelativistic configurations. Primitive basis sets for one- and two-component pseudopotential calculations have been optimized for the ground and excited states and exhibit finite basis set errors with respect to the finite-difference Hartree-Fock limit below 0.01 and 0.02 eV, respectively. General contraction schemes have been applied to obtain valence basis sets of polarized valence double- to quadruple-zeta quality. Results of atomic test calculations in the intermediate coupling scheme at the Fock-space coupled-cluster level are in good agreement with those of corresponding fully relativistic all-electron calculations based on the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate besides the well-known need of a relativistic treatment at the Dirac-Coulomb level also the necessity to include higher-order corrections for the superheavy elements.},

The results indicate that a polarized triple-zeta basis set of Slater-type orbitals is adequate for routine assessment of the performance of each method of computation. With such a basis set, seven density functionals were tested. In addition, the performance of 21 energy density functionals were computed from the density calculated with the statistical average of orbital potentials (SAOP). Among all the choices tested, the best density functional for core-electron binding energies of C to F turns out to be the combination of Perdew-Wang (1986) functional for exchange and the Perdew-Wang (1991) functional for correlation, confirming earlier studies based on contracted Gaussian-type orbitals. For this best functional, five Slater-type orbital basis sets were examined, ranging from polarized double-zeta quality to the largest set available in the ADF package. For the best functional with the best basis set, the average absolute deviation (AAD) of the calculated value from experiment is only 0.16eV. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The coexistence of two isomers for Au(15)(-) is firmly established with convincing experimental evidence and theoretical calculations.

It is shown that theoretical studies using traditional generalized gradient functionals are heavily biased towards 2D structures. For a correct prediction of the 2D-3D crossover point it is crucial to use density functionals yielding accurate jellium surface energies, such as the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS) functional or the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional modified for solids (PBEsol). Further, spin-orbit effects have to be included, and large, flexible basis sets employed. This combined theoretical-experimental approach is promising for larger gold and other metal clusters.},

We suggest that the MGGA's stronger tendency toward 3D structures arises from their smaller gradient enhancement. Moreover, we show how MGGAs, in contrast to generalize gradient approximations with smaller gradient enhancements, avoid overestimating the bond energies by combining the information contained in the reduced gradient and the kinetic energy.

Choosing the energetically lowest lying structures we obtain electronic properties by applying a larger basis set within an energy-consistent relativistic small-core pseudopotential approach. The possibility of extrapolating these properties to the bulk limit for such small cluster sizes is discussed. In contrast to previous calculations on cesium clusters [B. Assadollahzadeh et al., Phys. Rev. B 78, 245423 (2008)] we find a rather slow convergence of any of the properties toward the bulk limit. As a result, we cannot predict the onset of metallic character with increasing cluster size, and much larger clusters need to be considered to obtain any useful information about the bulk limit. Our calculated properties show a large odd-even cluster size oscillation in agreement, for example, with experimental ionization potentials and electron affinities. For the calculated polarizabilities we find a clear transition to lower values at Au14, the first cluster size where the predicted global minimum clearly shows a compact three-dimensional (3D) structure. Hence, the measurement of cluster polarizabilities is ideal to identify the 2D--$>$3D transition at low temperatures for gold. Our genetic algorithm confirms the pyramidal structure for Au20.},

Density functional theory predicts a planar D2h structure for Au10 in contrast to recent second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory calculations, which predict a 3D C2v arrangement. The validity of the use of single-reference second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset theory for near metallic systems remains, however, questionable. On the other hand, it is less than clear how well density functional approximations perform for such clusters. We, therefore, decided to carry out quantum chemical calculations for Au10 using a variety of different density functionals as well as wavefunction-based methods including coupled cluster theory to compare the different energetically low lying 2D and 3D cluster isomers. The results are perhaps not encouraging showing that most computational methods do not predict correctly the energetic sequence of isomers compared to coupled cluster theory. As perturbative triple corrections in the coupled cluster treatment change the order in cluster stability, the onset of 2D to 3D transition in these gold clusters remains elusive. As expected, second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset theory is not suitable for correctly describing such systems.},

The program creates symmetric planar drawings of the fullerene graph and generates accurate molecular 3D geometries by way of force-field optimization, serving as a good starting point for further quantum theoretical treatments. It includes a number of fullerene-to-fullerene transformations, such as Goldberg-Coxeter transforms, Stone-Wales transforms, Endo-Kroto, Yoshida-Fowler, and Brinkmann-Fowler vertex insertions. The program is written in standard Fortran and C++ and can easily be installed in a Linux or UNIX environment.},

  abstract = {Using the density functional theory and generalized gradient approximation for exchange and correlation potential, we have performed an extensive search to obtain the ground state geometries of both neutral and anionic Au(16) cluster by considering over 200 low lying isomers. For the neutral Au(16) cluster we found a new T(d) compact structure to be the lowest energy configuration, which is nearly degenerate in total energy with the previously reported C(s) and C(2v) noncage structures. While the Au(16) (-) cluster, in agreement with previous calculations, is found to have a T(d) hollow cage structure, an isomer with a planar structure is found to be lower in energy. The photoelectron spectra from all the nine lowest energy isomers are calculated and compared with experiment to determine the possibility of their existence. Molecular dynamics simulations on both neutral and anionic Au(16) clusters are carried out to provide further insight into the origin and stability of these structures. Our comprehensive study allows us to answer the following questions: (1) Why are the adiabatic and vertical detachment energies of Au(16) cluster nearly identical when the lowest energy structures of the anion and the neutral are so very different? (2) How is Au(16) (-) formed? Is it born neutral and the extra electron attaches afterwards or is it born anionic and the structure evolves during the electron attachment process?},

Here we examine in detail a mapping of configurations to saddle points using minimization of \$|$\backslash$nabla E|\^2\$, which has been used in previous work to support these theories. The examples we consider are a two-dimensional model energy surface and binary Lennard-Jones liquids and solids. A shortcoming of the mapping is its failure to divide the potential energy surface into basins of attraction surrounding saddle points, because there are many minima of \$|$\backslash$nabla E|\^2\$ that do not correspond to stationary points of the potential energy. In fact, most liquid configurations are mapped to such points for the system we consider. We therefore develop an alternative route to investigate higher-index saddle points and obtain near complete distributions of saddles for small Lennard-Jones clusters. The distribution of the number of stationary points as a function of the index is found to be Gaussian, and the average energy increases linearly with saddle point index in agreement with previous results for bulk systems.},

We discuss the stability of such systems at low energies and present detailed numerical investigations of the potential-energy surfaces of ``clusters'' of up to thirteen atoms interacting through Lennard-Jones and Morse potentials. Our main results comprise what we believe to be an almost exhaustive survey of the distinct minima available to systems of this size for the potentials used. Each such stable structure obtained is vibrationally and rotationally analysed and its symmetry is examined.The most striking feature of these results is the extreme sensitivity of the number of possible stable configurations to the range and softness of the pair potential. Thus, of no fewer than 988 minima for 13 Lennard-Jones atoms, only some 36 are supported by the ($\alpha$= 3) Morse potential. The minima available are also classified geometrically and it is shown that non-crystallographic configurations predominate in structures of both greatest and least binding energy.A preliminary account of the statistical mechanics of cluster systems based on the rigid-rotor/harmonic oscillator approximation is given.},

  abstract = {The densest local packings of N three-dimensional identical nonoverlapping spheres within a radius R(min)(N) of a fixed central sphere of the same size are obtained for selected values of N up to N=1054. In the predecessor to this paper [A. B. Hopkins, F. H. Stillinger, and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E 81, 041305 (2010)], we described our method for finding the putative densest packings of N spheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space R(d) and presented those packings in R(2) for values of N up to N=348. Here we analyze the properties and characteristics of the densest local packings in R(3) and employ knowledge of the R(min)(N), using methods applicable in any d, to construct both a realizability condition for pair correlation functions of sphere packings and an upper bound on the maximal density of infinite sphere packings. In R(3), we find wide variability in the densest local packings, including a multitude of packing symmetries such as perfect tetrahedral and imperfect icosahedral symmetry. We compare the densest local packings of N spheres near a central sphere to minimal-energy configurations of N+1 points interacting with short-range repulsive and long-range attractive pair potentials, e.g., 12-6 Lennard-Jones, and find that they are in general completely different, a result that has possible implications for nucleation theory. We also compare the densest local packings to finite subsets of stacking variants of the densest infinite packings in R(3) (the Barlow packings) and find that the densest local packings are almost always most similar as measured by a similarity metric, to the subsets of Barlow packings with the smallest number of coordination shells measured about a single central sphere, e.g., a subset of the fcc Barlow packing. Additionally, we observe that the densest local packings are dominated by the dense arrangement of spheres with centers at distance R(min)(N). In particular, we find two "maracas" packings at N=77 and N=93, each consisting of a few unjammed spheres free to rattle within a "husk" composed of the maximal number of spheres that can be packed with centers at respective R(min)(N).},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a significant growth in the development and application of methods for performing global optimization (GO) of cluster and nanoparticle structures using first-principles electronic structure methods coupled to sophisticated search algorithms. This has in part been driven by the desire to avoid the use of empirical potentials (EPs), especially in cases where no reliable potentials exist to guide the search toward reasonable regions of configuration space. This has been facilitated by improvements in the reliability of the search algorithms, increased efficiency of the electronic structure methods, and the development of faster, multiprocessor high-performance computing architectures. In this review, we give a brief overview of GO algorithms, though concentrating mainly on genetic algorithm and basin hopping techniques, first in combination with EPs. The major part of the review then deals with details of the implementation and application of these search methods to allow exploration for global minimum cluster structures directly using electronic structure methods and, in particular, density functional theory. Example applications are presented, ranging from isolated monometallic and bimetallic clusters to molecular clusters and ligated and surface supported metal clusters. Finally, some possible future developments are highlighted. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Solutions to the DLP problem are relevant to the realizability of pair correlation functions for packings of nonoverlapping spheres and might prove useful in improving upon the best known upper bounds on the maximum packing fraction of sphere packings in dimensions greater than three. The optimal spherical code problem in Rd involves the placement of the centers of N nonoverlapping spheres of unit diameter onto the surface of a sphere of radius R such that R is minimized. It is proved that in any dimension, all solutions between unity and the golden ratio to the optimal spherical code problem for N spheres are also solutions to the corresponding DLP problem. It follows that for any packing of nonoverlapping spheres of unit diameter, a spherical region of radius less than or equal to the golden ratio centered on an arbitrary sphere center cannot enclose a number of sphere centers greater than one more than the number that can be placed on the region's surface.},

The overall composition is presumed fixed, and the geometry is relaxed after each permutation in order to relieve local strain. From ideas used to solve graph partitioning problems we devise a deterministic search scheme that outperforms (by orders of magnitude) conventional and self-guided basin-hopping global optimisation. The search is guided by the energy gain from either swapping particles i and j ($\Delta$Eij) or changing the identity of particles i ($\Delta$Ei). These quantities are derived from the underlying (arbitrary) energy function, hence not constituting external bias, and for site-separable force fields each $\Delta$Ei can be approximated simply and efficiently. In our self-guided variant of basin-hopping, particles are weighted by an approximate $\Delta$Ei when randomly selected for an exchange, yielding a significant improvement for segregated multicomponent systems with modest particle size mismatch.},

  abstract = {Sphere packing problems have a rich history in both mathematics and physics; yet, relatively few analytical analyses of sphere packings exist, and answers to seemingly simple questions are unknown. Here, we present an analytical method for deriving all packings of n spheres in \$$\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\^3\$ satisfying minimal rigidity constraints (\$$\backslash$geq 3\$ contacts per sphere and \$$\backslash$geq 3n-6\$ total contacts). We derive such packings for \$n $\backslash$leq 10\$ and provide a preliminary set of maximum contact packings for \$10 $<$ n $\backslash$leq 20\$. The resultant set of packings has some striking features; among them are the following: (i) all minimally rigid packings for \$n $\backslash$leq 9\$ have exactly \$3n-6\$ contacts; (ii) nonrigid packings satisfying minimal rigidity constraints arise for \$n $\backslash$geq 9\$; (iii) the number of ground states (i.e., packings with the maximum number of contacts) oscillates with respect to n; (iv) for \$10 $\backslash$leq n $\backslash$leq 20\$ there are only a small number of packings with the maximum number of contacts, and for \$10 $\backslash$leq n $<$ 13\$ these are all commensurate with the hexagonal close-packed lattice. The general method presented here may have applications to other related problems in mathematics, such as the Erd{\"o}s repeated distance problem and Euclidean distance matrix completion problems.},

We consider the free-energy landscape of such systems as the range of the potential goes to zero. In this limit, the landscape is entirely defined by geometrical manifolds, plus a single control parameter. These manifolds are fundamental objects that do not depend on the details of the interaction potential and provide the starting point from which any quantity characterizing the system--equilibrium or nonequilibrium--can be computed for arbitrary potentials. To consider dynamical quantities we compute the asymptotic limit of the Fokker-Planck equation and show that it becomes restricted to the low-dimensional manifolds connected by "sticky" boundary conditions. To illustrate our theory, we compute the low-dimensional manifolds for n $\leq$ 8 identical particles, providing a complete description of the lowest-energy parts of the landscape including floppy modes with up to 2 internal degrees of freedom. The results can be directly tested on colloidal clusters. This limit is a unique approach for understanding energy landscapes, and our hope is that it can also provide insight into finite-range potentials.},

  abstract = {Packing problems, which ask how to arrange a collection of objects in space to meet certain criteria, are important in a great many physical and biological systems, where geometrical arrangements at small scales control behavior at larger ones. In many systems there is no single, optimal packing that dominates, but rather one must understand the entire set of possible packings. As a step in this direction we enumerate rigid clusters of identical hard spheres for \$n$\backslash$leq 14\$ and clusters with the maximum number of contacts for \$n$\backslash$leq  19\$. A rigid cluster is one that cannot be continuously deformed while maintaining all contacts. This is a nonlinear notion that arises naturally because such clusters are the metastable states when the spheres interact with a short-range potential, as is the case in many nano- or microscale systems. We believe that our lists are nearly complete, except for a small number of highly singular clusters (linearly floppy but nonlinearly rigid).  The data contains some major geometrical surprises, such as the prevalence of hypostatic clusters: those with less than the \$3n-6\$ contacts generically necessary for rigidity. We discuss these and several other unusual clusters whose geometries may give insight into physical mechanisms, pose mathematical and computational problems, or bring inspiration for designing new materials.},

  abstract = {Networks of particles connected by springs model many condensed-matter systems, from colloids interacting with a short-range potential and complex fluids near jamming, to self-assembled lattices and various metamaterials. Under small thermal fluctuations the vibrational entropy of a ground state is given by the harmonic approximation if it has no zero-frequency vibrational modes, yet such singular modes are at the epicenter of many interesting behaviors in the systems above. We consider a system of N spherical particles, and directly account for the singularities that arise in the sticky limit where the pairwise interaction is strong and short ranged. Although the contribution to the partition function from singular clusters diverges in the limit, its asymptotic value can be calculated and depends on only two parameters, characterizing the depth and range of the potential. The result holds for systems that are second-order rigid, a geometric characterization that describes all known ground-state (rigid) sticky clusters. To illustrate the applications of our theory we address the question of emergence: how does crystalline order arise in large systems when it is strongly disfavored in small ones? We calculate the partition functions of all known rigid clusters up to N$\leq$21 and show the cluster landscape is dominated by hyperstatic clusters (those with more than 3N-6 contacts); singular and isostatic clusters are far less frequent, despite their extra vibrational and configurational entropies. Since the most hyperstatic clusters are close to fragments of a close-packed lattice, this underlies the emergence of order in sticky-sphere systems, even those as small as N=10.},

  abstract = {An accurate potential energy curve has been derived for the xenon dimer using state-of-the-art relativistic coupled-cluster theory up to quadruple excitations accounting for both basis set superposition and incompleteness errors. The data obtained is fitted to a computationally efficient extended Lennard-Jones potential form and to a modified Tang\textendash{}Toennies potential function treating the short- and long-range part separately. The vibrational spectrum of Xe2 obtained from a numerical solution of the rovibrational Schr{\"o}dinger equation and subsequently derived spectroscopic constants are in excellent agreement with experimental values. We further present solid-state calculations for xenon using a static many-body expansion up to fourth-order in the xenon interaction potential including dynamic effects within the Einstein approximation. Again we find very good agreement with the experimental (face-centred cubic) lattice constant and cohesive energy.},

  abstract = {The area of a spherical region can be easily measured by considering which sampling points of a lattice are located inside or outside the region. This point-counting technique is frequently used for measuring the Earth coverage of satellite constellations, employing a latitude\textendash{}longitude lattice. This paper analyzes the numerical errors of such measurements, and shows that they could be greatly reduced if the Fibonacci lattice were used instead. The latter is a mathematical idealization of natural patterns with optimal packing, where the area represented by each point is almost identical. Using the Fibonacci lattice would reduce the root mean squared error by at least 40\%. If, as is commonly the case, around a million lattice points are used, the maximum error would be an order of magnitude smaller.},

  doi = {10.1145/2816795.2818131},
  abstract = {Spherical Fibonacci point sets yield nearly uniform point distributions on the unit sphere S2 $\subset$ R3. The forward generation of these point sets has been widely researched and is easy to implement, such that they have been used in various applications. Unfortunately, the lack of an efficient mapping from points on the unit sphere to their closest spherical Fibonacci point set neighbors rendered them impractical for a wide range of applications, especially in computer graphics. Therefore, we introduce an inverse mapping from points on the unit sphere which yields the nearest neighbor in an arbitrarily sized spherical Fibonacci point set in constant time, without requiring any precomputations or table lookups. We show how to implement this inverse mapping on GPUs while addressing arising floating point precision problems. Further, we demonstrate the use of this mapping and its variants, and show how to apply it to fast unit vector quantization. Finally, we illustrate the means by which to modify this inverse mapping for texture mapping with smooth filter kernels and showcase its use in the field of procedural modeling.},
