# From Mathematical Models to Quantum Chemistry in Cluster Science

My PhD thesis written in LaTeX using [biblatex](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex?lang=en) and [biber](https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/) for bibliography generation. I used [Zotero]() to manage my library and generate `.bib` files.
