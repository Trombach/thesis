\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

The following chapters should provide an overview of the theoretical backround
neccesarry to carry out the presented calculations. Most of it is based on
standard literature from \textsc{Jensen}\autocite{jensen_introduction_2006}, \textsc{Szabo} and
\textsc{Ostlund}\autocite{} and \textsc{Holthausen} and
\textsc{Koch}\autocite{}.

\subsubsection{The Schr\"odinger Equation}

The discovery of the wave-particle duality at the beginning of the 20th centuary lead to a complete reformulation of the physical laws governing the smallest of particles. \textsc{Erwin Schr\"odinger} established a framework based on \textsc{abc}
