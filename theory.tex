\section{An Introduction to Quantum Chemistry}
\label{sec:IntroductiontoQM}

Parts of this thesis require knowledge of standard methods used in quantum
chemistry. The following chapters introduce the fundamentals of quantum
mechanics and their application to chemistry related questions. Most of it is
based on standard literature by Jensen\autocite{jensen_introduction_2006},
Szabo and Ostlund\autocite{szabo_modern_1996} and Holthausen and
Koch\autocite{koch_chemists_2001}.

\subsection{The Schr\"odinger Equation}

The beginning of the 20th centuary was a very important time for modern
theoretical sciences. Discoveries like Planck's energy quantisation based on
black body radiation or the discovery of the wave particle dualism by de
Broglie lead to a complete reformulation of the physical laws governing the
smallest of particles. Erwin Schr\"odinger established a framework based on
Hamiltonian mechanics that set the wave function $\Psi$ at the center of
attention. It contains all information about the system and its evolution in
time. For ground-state calculations it is usually sufficient to look at
solutions to the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation.

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{H}\Psi=E\Psi\label{eqn:SchrodingerEquation}
\end{equation}

In this eigenvalue equation the Hamilton operator $\mathbf{H}$ acts on the wave
function which results in a solution for the total energyi $E$ of the system. 

The wave function is a function of all spatial $\mathbf{r}$ and spin
coordinates $\omega$ of all the particles in the system and will be denoted
$\mathbf{x}$ on the following pages.  

\begin{align}
	\mathbf{x}=\{\mathbf{r},\omega\}
\end{align}

The square of the wave function is usually interpreted as a probability density
which is used to normalise it such that the probability of finding and electron
anywhere in space is one.

\begin{align}
	\int |\Psi(\mathbf{x})|^2\dif \mathbf{x}_1\dif \mathbf{x}_2\ldots\dif \mathbf{x}_N=\braket{\Psi(\mathbf{x})|\Psi(\mathbf{x})}=1
\end{align}

The information contained in the wave function can be accessed by an operator
$\mathbf{O}$ acting on the wave function and forming a eigenvalue equation. In
equation~\eqref{eqn:SchrodingerEquation} this operator is the Hamilton
operator, but it could be any operator connected to a physical observable.
Generally the eigenvalue of an arbitrary operator $\braket{\mathbf{O}}$ is
defined as

\begin{equation}
	\braket{\mathbf{O}}=\frac{\braket{\Psi(\mathbf{x})|\mathbf{O}|\Psi(\mathbf{x})}}{\braket{\Psi(\mathbf{x})|\Psi(\mathbf{x})}},
\end{equation}

or for normalised wave functions

\begin{align}
	\braket{\mathbf{O}}=\braket{\Psi(\mathbf{x})|\mathbf{O}|\Psi(\mathbf{x})}.
\end{align}

For a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ nuclei the non-relativistic Hamilton
operator in atomic units has the form

\begin{align}
\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{H}&=\mathbf{T}_\text{e} + \mathbf{V}_\text{ee} + \mathbf{T}_\text{n} + \mathbf{V}_\text{nn} + \mathbf{V}_\text{en} \\
    &=-\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2
    + \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j>i}^NV_{ij}
    - \sum_{A=1}^M\frac{1}{2}\nabla_A^2
    + \sum_{A=1}^M\sum_{B>A}^MV_{AB}
    + \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{A=1}^MV_{iA}.\label{eqn:hamiltonoperator}
\end{aligned}
\end{align}

The operator contains the kinetic energy of the electrons
$\mathbf{T}_\text{e}$, the electron repulsion $\mathbf{V}_\text{ee}$, the
kinetic energy of the nuclei $\mathbf{T}_\text{n}$, the nucleon repulsion
$\mathbf{V}_\text{nn}$ and the electron-nucleus attraction
$\mathbf{V}_\text{en}$.

\subsection{The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation}

For quantum chemical applications the coupling of the movement of the electrons
and nuclei is usually neglected. This is possible because the atomic mass $m_A$
is so much greater than the electronic mass $m_i$, resulting in much lower
velocities for nuclei compared to electrons. Therefore, the electrons can be
considred to be moving in a static field of nuclei, meaning the nuclear kinetic
term $\mathbf{T}_\text{n}$ can be neglected and the nuclear repulsion term
$\mathbf{V}_\text{nn}$ becomes a constant. The resulting electronic Hamilton
operator $\mathbf{H}_\text{e}$ describes electrons moving in a field of
positive point charges.

\begin{align}
    \mathbf{H}_\text{e}=\mathbf{T}_\text{e} + \mathbf{V}_\text{ee} + \mathbf{V}_\text{en}
\end{align}

Solving the Schr\"dinger equation for this operator yields the electronic wave
function $\Psi_\text{e}$. It depends explicitly on the electronic coordinates,
but only parametrically on the nuclear coordinates, therefore spanning a
potential energy surface upon which the nuclei move. To get the total energy of
the system the constant repulsion between the nuclei has to be added to the
electronic operator.

\begin{align}
    \mathbf{H}=\mathbf{H}_\text{e}+V_\text{nn}\label{eqn:hamiltonoperatorfinal}
\end{align}

\subsection{The Hartree-Fock Approximation}

An exact solution to the Schr\"odinger equation in the boundary conditions of
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for systems containing more than one
electron is not possible. The solution has to be approximated by appropriate
methods; one possible solution are the Hartree-Fock equations. This set of
equations determines the energy of a wave function expressed as a Slater
determinant $\Phi_\text{SD}$.

\begin{equation}
     \Phi_{SD}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
     \begin{vmatrix}
         \phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1) & \phi_2(\mathbf{x}_1) & \cdots & \phi_N(\mathbf{x}_1)\\
         \phi_1(\mathbf{x}_2) & \phi_2 (\mathbf{x}_2) & \cdots & \phi_N(\mathbf{x}_2)\\
         \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
         \phi_1(\mathbf{x}_N) & \phi_2(\mathbf{x}_N) & \cdots & \phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)
     \end{vmatrix}
     \label{eqn:SlaterDet}
\end{equation}

Here, the $\phi_i$ denote one electron spin orbitals and
$\mathbf{x}_i=\{\mathbf{r}_i,\omega_i\}$ are spatial ($\mathbf{r}_i$) and spin
($\omega_i$) coordinates of the electrons. A Slater determinant obeys the Pauli
exclusion principle, which requires the electronic wave function to be
anti-symmetric with respect to interchanging the coordinates of two electrons.

In the Hartree-Fock approximation the energy of a single Slater determinant is
used as an approximation for the total energy of the system. As explained
previously, the energy of a wave function can be determined by the action of
the Hamilton operator on the wave function. The Hamilton operator in the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation from equation~\eqref{eqn:hamiltonoperatorfinal}
can be rewritten in terms of one-electron operators $\mathbf{h}_i$.

\begin{align}
\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{H}&=\sum_i^N\left(\mathbf{h}_i + \sum_{j>i}^N\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j|}\right) + V_\text{nn} \\
    \mathbf{h}_i&=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2-\sum_A^M\frac{Z_A}{|\mathbf{r}_A-\mathbf{r}_i|}\label{eqn:hamiltonoperatorhartreefock}
\end{aligned}
\end{align}

Here, $Z_A$ denotes the charge of nucleus $A$. $\mathbf{h}_i$ depends only on
the kinetic energy of electron $i$ and its potential energy in the field of all
$M$ nuclei. When $\mathbf{h}_i$ acts on a Slater determinant the result is the
respective matrix element $h_i$. Only parts of the Slater determinant without
permutation of electron coordinates can give a non-zero contribution to the
eigenvalue.

\begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
        h_1&=\braket{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)\ldots\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)|\mathbf{h}_1|\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)\ldots\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)}\\
        &=\braket{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)|\mathbf{h}_1|\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)}\braket{\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)|\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)}\ldots\braket{\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)|\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)} \\
        &=\braket{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)|\mathbf{h}_1|\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}

The remainder of the Hamilton operator from
equation~\eqref{eqn:hamiltonoperatorhartreefock} is dependant on two electron
coordinates. It is convenient to define a two-electron operator $\mathbf{g}_{ij}$
with the matrix elements $g_{ij}=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j|}$. Its
action on the part of the Slater determinant with no permutation of electron
coordinates results in the Coulomb integral and the corresponding matrix
element $J_{ij}$, which can be seen as the classical Coulomb repulsion.

\begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
        J_{12}&=\braket{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)\ldots\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)|\mathbf{g}_{12}|\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)\ldots\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)}\\
        &=\braket{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)|\mathbf{g}_{12}|\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)}\ldots\braket{\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)|\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)} \\
        &=\braket{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)|\mathbf{g}_{12}|\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}

As $\mathbf{g}_{ij}$ depends on the coordinates of two electrons it also yields
non-zero matrix elements for parts of the Slater determinant, where two
electron coordinates have been swapped.

\begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
        K_{12}&=\braket{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)\ldots\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)|\mathbf{g}_{12}|\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_2)\ldots\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)}\\
        &=\braket{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)|\mathbf{g}_{12}|\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_2)}\ldots\braket{\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)|\phi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)} \\
        &=\braket{\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_2)|\mathbf{g}_{12}|\phi_2(\mathbf{x}_1)\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_2)}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}

$K_{ij}$ is called the exchange integral and has no classical interpretation.
As swapping coordinates in the Slater determinant changes its sign, the result
of the exchange integral has a negative sign. The total energy of the system is
now given by the sum over all integrals described above.

\begin{align}
    E=\sum_{i=1}^Nh_i + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^N(J_{ij}-K_{ij})+V_\text{nn}
\end{align}
