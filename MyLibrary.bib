	abstract = {Energy landscape approaches have become increasingly popular for analyzing a wide variety of chemical physics phenomena. Basic to many of these applications has been the inherent structure mapping, which divides up the potential energy landscape into basins of attraction surrounding the minima. Here, we probe the nature of this division by introducing a method to compute the basin area distribution and applying it to some archetypal supercooled liquids. We find that this probability distribution is a power law over a large number of decades with the lower-energy minima having larger basins of attraction. Interestingly, the exponent for this power law is approximately the same as that for a high-dimensional Apollonian packing, providing further support for the suggestion that there is a strong analogy between the way the energy landscape is divided into basins, and the way that space is packed in self-similar, space-filling hypersphere packings, such as the Apollonian packing. These results suggest that the basins of attraction provide a fractal-like tiling of the energy landscape, and that a scale-free pattern of connections between the minima is a general property of energy landscapes.},

The attachment rate is a control parameter. The resulting network representing the aggregation of up to 14 particles contains 6427 vertices. It is not only time-irreversible but also reducible. To analyze its transient dynamics, we introduce the sequence of the expected initial and pre-attachment distributions and compute them for a wide range of attachment rates and three values of temperature. As a result, we find the configurations most likely to be observed in the process of aggregation for each cluster size. We examine the attachment process and conduct a structural analysis of the sets of local energy minima for every cluster size. We show that both processes taking place in the network, attachment and relaxation, lead to the dominance of icosahedral packing in small (up to 14 atom) clusters.},

The shapes considered are oblate and prolate spheroids, with the aspect ratio varying from 0.1 to 7.0. It is shown that the predicted relationship between packing fraction and aspect ratio is consistent with those reported in the literature. Ellipsoids can pack more densely than spheres. The maximum packing fraction occurs at an aspect ratio of 0.6 for oblate spheroids, and 1.80 for prolate spheroids. The packing characteristics with aspect ratio are further analyzed in terms of structural parameters such as coordination number and radial distribution function. It is shown that ellipsoids with small or large aspect ratios tend to give a locally ordered structure. The results demonstrate that {DEM} provides a useful method to investigate the packing dynamics of ellipsoidal particles.},

Unfortunately, the lack of an efficient mapping from points on the unit sphere to their closest spherical Fibonacci point set neighbors rendered them impractical for a wide range of applications, especially in computer graphics. Therefore, we introduce an inverse mapping from points on the unit sphere which yields the nearest neighbor in an arbitrarily sized spherical Fibonacci point set in constant time, without requiring any precomputations or table lookups. We show how to implement this inverse mapping on {GPUs} while addressing arising floating point precision problems. Further, we demonstrate the use of this mapping and its variants, and show how to apply it to fast unit vector quantization. Finally, we illustrate the means by which to modify this inverse mapping for texture mapping with smooth filter kernels and showcase its use in the field of procedural modeling.},

This paper analyzes the numerical errors of such measurements, and shows that they could be greatly reduced if the Fibonacci lattice were used instead. The latter is a mathematical idealization of natural patterns with optimal packing, where the area represented by each point is almost identical. Using the Fibonacci lattice would reduce the root mean squared error by at least 40\%. If, as is commonly the case, around a million lattice points are used, the maximum error would be an order of magnitude smaller.},

	abstract = {Networks of particles connected by springs model many condensed-matter systems, from colloids interacting with a short-range potential and complex fluids near jamming, to self-assembled lattices and various metamaterials. Under small thermal fluctuations the vibrational entropy of a ground state is given by the harmonic approximation if it has no zero-frequency vibrational modes, yet such singular modes are at the epicenter of many interesting behaviors in the systems above. We consider a system of N spherical particles, and directly account for the singularities that arise in the sticky limit where the pairwise interaction is strong and short ranged. Although the contribution to the partition function from singular clusters diverges in the limit, its asymptotic value can be calculated and depends on only two parameters, characterizing the depth and range of the potential. The result holds for systems that are second-order rigid, a geometric characterization that describes all known ground-state (rigid) sticky clusters. To illustrate the applications of our theory we address the question of emergence: how does crystalline order arise in large systems when it is strongly disfavored in small ones? We calculate the partition functions of all known rigid clusters up to N≤21 and show the cluster landscape is dominated by hyperstatic clusters (those with more than 3N−6 contacts); singular and isostatic clusters are far less frequent, despite their extra vibrational and configurational entropies. Since the most hyperstatic clusters are close to fragments of a close-packed lattice, this underlies the emergence of order in sticky-sphere systems, even those as small as N=10.},

	abstract = {Packing problems, which ask how to arrange a collection of objects in space to meet certain criteria, are important in a great many physical and biological systems, where geometrical arrangements at small scales control behavior at larger ones. In many systems there is no single, optimal packing that dominates, but rather one must understand the entire set of possible packings. As a step in this direction we enumerate rigid clusters of identical hard spheres for \$n{\textbackslash}leq 14\$ and clusters with the maximum number of contacts for \$n{\textbackslash}leq  19\$. A rigid cluster is one that cannot be continuously deformed while maintaining all contacts. This is a nonlinear notion that arises naturally because such clusters are the metastable states when the spheres interact with a short-range potential, as is the case in many nano- or microscale systems. We believe that our lists are nearly complete, except for a small number of highly singular clusters (linearly floppy but nonlinearly rigid).  The data contains some major geometrical surprises, such as the prevalence of hypostatic clusters: those with less than the \$3n-6\$ contacts generically necessary for rigidity. We discuss these and several other unusual clusters whose geometries may give insight into physical mechanisms, pose mathematical and computational problems, or bring inspiration for designing new materials.},

We consider the free-energy landscape of such systems as the range of the potential goes to zero. In this limit, the landscape is entirely defined by geometrical manifolds, plus a single control parameter. These manifolds are fundamental objects that do not depend on the details of the interaction potential and provide the starting point from which any quantity characterizing the system--equilibrium or nonequilibrium--can be computed for arbitrary potentials. To consider dynamical quantities we compute the asymptotic limit of the Fokker-Planck equation and show that it becomes restricted to the low-dimensional manifolds connected by "sticky" boundary conditions. To illustrate our theory, we compute the low-dimensional manifolds for n ≤ 8 identical particles, providing a complete description of the lowest-energy parts of the landscape including floppy modes with up to 2 internal degrees of freedom. The results can be directly tested on colloidal clusters. This limit is a unique approach for understanding energy landscapes, and our hope is that it can also provide insight into finite-range potentials.},

We derive such packings for \$n {\textbackslash}leq 10\$ and provide a preliminary set of maximum contact packings for \$10 {\textless} n {\textbackslash}leq 20\$. The resultant set of packings has some striking features; among them are the following: (i) all minimally rigid packings for \$n {\textbackslash}leq 9\$ have exactly \$3n-6\$ contacts; (ii) nonrigid packings satisfying minimal rigidity constraints arise for \$n {\textbackslash}geq 9\$; (iii) the number of ground states (i.e., packings with the maximum number of contacts) oscillates with respect to n; (iv) for \$10 {\textbackslash}leq n {\textbackslash}leq 20\$ there are only a small number of packings with the maximum number of contacts, and for \$10 {\textbackslash}leq n {\textless} 13\$ these are all commensurate with the hexagonal close-packed lattice.

Yet the densest packing of congruent hard ellipsoids, which is intimately related to the high-density phase of many condensed matter systems, is still an open problem. We discover an unusual family of dense crystalline packings of self-dual ellipsoids (ratios of the semiaxes α:√α:1), containing 24 particles with a quasi-square-triangular ({SQ}-{TR}) tiling arrangement in the fundamental cell. The associated packing density ϕ exceeds that of the densest known {SM}2 crystal [ A. Donev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 255506 (2004)] for aspect ratios α in (1.365, 1.5625), attaining a maximal ϕ≈0.75806... at α=93/64. We show that the {SQ}-{TR} phase derived from these dense packings is thermodynamically stable at high densities over the aforementioned α range and report a phase diagram for self-dual ellipsoids. The discovery of the {SQ}-{TR} crystal suggests organizing principles for nonspherical particles and self-assembly of colloidal systems.},

For obvious reasons most of the paper deals with C60 but the materials reviewed also include C70, simple derivatives of C60, carbon nanotubes, and intercalation compounds of C60 with both acceptors and donors, mainly alkali metals. After a brief overview of high-pressure techniques and the structures and properties of C60 at atmospheric pressure, the structural phase diagram of C60 from atmospheric pressure to above 40GPa (400kbar) is reviewed. The evolution with pressure of the orientational and translational structure of 'normal' molecular C60 in the range up to 1-5GPa (depending on temperature) is discussed in some detail, as is the appearance of a large number of polymeric phases at higher pressures and temperatures, some of them known to have extreme mechanical properties. At very high static (or shock) pressures or temperatures, C60 transforms into ordered or disordered forms of diamond or graphite. The phase diagram is reasonably well investigated up to near 10GPa, but at higher pressures there are still large gaps in our knowledge. Available experimental data for the physical properties of both monomeric and polymeric C60 under high pressures are reviewed as far as possible. The compression behaviour of C60 has been well investigated and is discussed in detail because of its basic importance, but optical, electrical and lattice properties have also been studied for several of the many structural phases of C60. Whenever possible, experimental data are compared with the results of theoretical calculations. The phase diagram and properties of C70 are much less known because of the larger complexity caused by the anisotropy of the molecule, and very little is known about most compounds of C60. However, noble-gas intercalation in C60 has been reasonably well investigated. Finally, the high-pressure properties of superconducting alkali-metalintercalated C60 are briefly reviewed.},

Both simulation methods, when tested for Lennard-Jones crystals, give accurate results of the free energy differing from each other in the fifth significant digit. The solid-solid phase transition temperature of C60 crystal is determined from free energy profiles, and found to be 260 K, which is in good agreement with experiment. For C70 crystal, using the potential model of Sprik et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 1660 (1992)], low-temperature solid-solid phase transition temperature is found to be 160 K determined from the free energy profiles. Whereas this is somewhat lower than the experimental value, it is in agreement with conventional molecular simulations, which validates the methodological consistency of the present simulation method. From the calculations of the free energies of C60 and C70 crystals, we note the significance of symmetry number for crystal phase needed to properly account for the indistinguishability of orientationally disordered states.},

Probing the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the densest packings is a problem of interest in discrete geometry and number theory. Previous work has focused mainly on spherical particles—very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. Here we formulate the generation of dense packings of polyhedra as an optimization problem, using an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions (we term this the 'adaptive shrinking cell' scheme). Using a variety of multi-particle initial configurations, we find the densest known packings of the four non-tiling Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The densities are 0.782, 0.947, 0.904... and 0.836..., respectively. Unlike the densest tetrahedral packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Combining our simulation results with derived rigorous upper bounds and theoretical arguments leads us to the conjecture that the densest packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings. This is the analogue of Kepler's sphere conjecture for these solids.},

Starting from the two dimensionally polymerized tetragonal phase, we find a new stable three dimensionally polymerized structure to be synthesized under uniaxial pressure of about 20 {GPa}. In sharp contrast to other polymerized C60 phases and to solid C60, the new polymer possesses metallic electronic structure with a relatively large Fermi-level density of states. Its conduction-electron distribution and the energetics are studied in detail.},

Owing to hybrid networks of sp2-like (threefold coordinated) and sp3-like (fourfold coordinated) carbon atoms, the electronic structure of these phases is considerably different from that of face-centered-cubic (fcc) C60. Both systems are found to be elemental semiconductors having small indirect gaps. Furthermore, since the interlayer distance between adjacent polymerized planes for both phases is small, these systems are found to have three-dimensional electronic structures. From structural optimizations under the experimental lattice parameters, we reveal energetic high stabilities of these phases. In particular, the tetragonal phase is found to be considerably more stable in energy than the fcc phase. Its high stability is caused by the formation of intercluster bonds whose energy gain is larger than the energy loss due to the distortion of the carbon networks of C60 units upon polymerization.},

When treated at 500° to 800°C at the same pressure, C60 transforms into a rhombohedral structure with hexagonal lattice parameters of ao = 9.22 angstroms and co = 24.6 angstroms. The intermolecular distance is small enough that a chemical bond can form, in accord with the reduced solubility of the pressure-induced phases.

The value of the dimerization activation energy was determined to be Ea(dim)=134±6kJmol−1, assuming the second order irreversible reaction.

The C60 dimers C120O (refs 16, 17), C121H2( ref. 17) and C120O2(ref. 18) have been reported, in which the two C60molecules are linked by, respectively, a furan group, a cyclopentane ring and a cyclobutane ring plus two oxygen bridges; but the simplest dimer, C120linked by a cyclobutane ring alone, has not so far been observed. We now report that this dumb-bell-shaped molecule can be synthesized by a solid-state mechanochemical reaction of C60 with potassium cyanide. Our X-ray structural analysis shows that the C4 ring connecting the cages is square rather than rectangular—the latter is predicted theoretically8, 9, 13, 14, 15. The dimer dissociates cleanly into two C60 molecules on heating or one-electron reduction, but in the gas phase during mass-spectrometric measurements it undergoes successive loss of C2 units, shrinking to even-numbered fullerenes such as C118 and C116 in a sequence similar to that seen for other large fullerenes19, 20.},

Solutions to the {DLP} problem are relevant to the realizability of pair correlation functions for packings of nonoverlapping spheres and might prove useful in improving upon the best known upper bounds on the maximum packing fraction of sphere packings in dimensions greater than three. The optimal spherical code problem in Rd involves the placement of the centers of N nonoverlapping spheres of unit diameter onto the surface of a sphere of radius R such that R is minimized. It is proved that in any dimension, all solutions between unity and the golden ratio to the optimal spherical code problem for N spheres are also solutions to the corresponding {DLP} problem. It follows that for any packing of nonoverlapping spheres of unit diameter, a spherical region of radius less than or equal to the golden ratio centered on an arbitrary sphere center cannot enclose a number of sphere centers greater than one more than the number that can be placed on the region's surface.},

We discuss the stability of such systems at low energies and present detailed numerical investigations of the potential-energy surfaces of “clusters” of up to thirteen atoms interacting through Lennard-Jones and Morse potentials. Our main results comprise what we believe to be an almost exhaustive survey of the distinct minima available to systems of this size for the potentials used. Each such stable structure obtained is vibrationally and rotationally analysed and its symmetry is examined.The most striking feature of these results is the extreme sensitivity of the number of possible stable configurations to the range and softness of the pair potential. Thus, of no fewer than 988 minima for 13 Lennard-Jones atoms, only some 36 are supported by the (α= 3) Morse potential. The minima available are also classified geometrically and it is shown that non-crystallographic configurations predominate in structures of both greatest and least binding energy.A preliminary account of the statistical mechanics of cluster systems based on the rigid-rotor/harmonic oscillator approximation is given.},

	abstract = {The densest local packings of N three-dimensional identical nonoverlapping spheres within a radius R(min)(N) of a fixed central sphere of the same size are obtained for selected values of N up to N=1054. In the predecessor to this paper [A. B. Hopkins, F. H. Stillinger, and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E 81, 041305 (2010)], we described our method for finding the putative densest packings of N spheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space R(d) and presented those packings in R(2) for values of N up to N=348. Here we analyze the properties and characteristics of the densest local packings in R(3) and employ knowledge of the R(min)(N), using methods applicable in any d, to construct both a realizability condition for pair correlation functions of sphere packings and an upper bound on the maximal density of infinite sphere packings. In R(3), we find wide variability in the densest local packings, including a multitude of packing symmetries such as perfect tetrahedral and imperfect icosahedral symmetry. We compare the densest local packings of N spheres near a central sphere to minimal-energy configurations of N+1 points interacting with short-range repulsive and long-range attractive pair potentials, e.g., 12-6 Lennard-Jones, and find that they are in general completely different, a result that has possible implications for nucleation theory. We also compare the densest local packings to finite subsets of stacking variants of the densest infinite packings in R(3) (the Barlow packings) and find that the densest local packings are almost always most similar as measured by a similarity metric, to the subsets of Barlow packings with the smallest number of coordination shells measured about a single central sphere, e.g., a subset of the fcc Barlow packing. Additionally, we observe that the densest local packings are dominated by the dense arrangement of spheres with centers at distance R(min)(N). In particular, we find two "maracas" packings at N=77 and N=93, each consisting of a few unjammed spheres free to rattle within a "husk" composed of the maximal number of spheres that can be packed with centers at respective R(min)(N).},

The overall composition is presumed fixed, and the geometry is relaxed after each permutation in order to relieve local strain. From ideas used to solve graph partitioning problems we devise a deterministic search scheme that outperforms (by orders of magnitude) conventional and self-guided basin-hopping global optimisation. The search is guided by the energy gain from either swapping particles i and j (ΔEij) or changing the identity of particles i (ΔEi). These quantities are derived from the underlying (arbitrary) energy function, hence not constituting external bias, and for site-separable force fields each ΔEi can be approximated simply and efficiently. In our self-guided variant of basin-hopping, particles are weighted by an approximate ΔEi when randomly selected for an exchange, yielding a significant improvement for segregated multicomponent systems with modest particle size mismatch.},

The transformation associates any point in configuration space with the local minimum obtained by a geometry optimization started from that point, effectively removing transition state regions from the problem. However, unlike other methods based upon hypersurface deformation, this transformation does not change the global minimum. The lowest known structures are located for all Lennard-Jones clusters up to 110 atoms, including a number that have never been found before in unbiased searches.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a significant growth in the development and application of methods for performing global optimization ({GO}) of cluster and nanoparticle structures using first-principles electronic structure methods coupled to sophisticated search algorithms. This has in part been driven by the desire to avoid the use of empirical potentials ({EPs}), especially in cases where no reliable potentials exist to guide the search toward reasonable regions of configuration space. This has been facilitated by improvements in the reliability of the search algorithms, increased efficiency of the electronic structure methods, and the development of faster, multiprocessor high-performance computing architectures. In this review, we give a brief overview of {GO} algorithms, though concentrating mainly on genetic algorithm and basin hopping techniques, first in combination with {EPs}. The major part of the review then deals with details of the implementation and application of these search methods to allow exploration for global minimum cluster structures directly using electronic structure methods and, in particular, density functional theory. Example applications are presented, ranging from isolated monometallic and bimetallic clusters to molecular clusters and ligated and surface supported metal clusters. Finally, some possible future developments are highlighted. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The properties of higher-index saddle points have been invoked in recent theories of the dynamics of supercooled liquids. Here we examine in detail a mapping of configurations to saddle points using minimization of \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}nabla E{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\$, which has been used in previous work to support these theories. The examples we consider are a two-dimensional model energy surface and binary Lennard-Jones liquids and solids. A shortcoming of the mapping is its failure to divide the potential energy surface into basins of attraction surrounding saddle points, because there are many minima of \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}nabla E{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\$ that do not correspond to stationary points of the potential energy. In fact, most liquid configurations are mapped to such points for the system we consider. We therefore develop an alternative route to investigate higher-index saddle points and obtain near complete distributions of saddles for small Lennard-Jones clusters. The distribution of the number of stationary points as a function of the index is found to be Gaussian, and the average energy increases linearly with saddle point index in agreement with previous results for bulk systems.},

For the neutral Au(16) cluster we found a new T(d) compact structure to be the lowest energy configuration, which is nearly degenerate in total energy with the previously reported C(s) and C(2v) noncage structures. While the Au(16) (-) cluster, in agreement with previous calculations, is found to have a T(d) hollow cage structure, an isomer with a planar structure is found to be lower in energy. The photoelectron spectra from all the nine lowest energy isomers are calculated and compared with experiment to determine the possibility of their existence. Molecular dynamics simulations on both neutral and anionic Au(16) clusters are carried out to provide further insight into the origin and stability of these structures. Our comprehensive study allows us to answer the following questions: (1) Why are the adiabatic and vertical detachment energies of Au(16) cluster nearly identical when the lowest energy structures of the anion and the neutral are so very different? (2) How is Au(16) (-) formed? Is it born neutral and the extra electron attaches afterwards or is it born anionic and the structure evolves during the electron attachment process?},

	abstract = {The icosahedral cluster-compound {WAu}12 was recently predicted by Pyykko¨ and Runeberg and experimentally prepared in the gas phase by the group of Lai-Sheng Wang. The photoelectron spectra and electron affinity were reported; the other physical properties remain unknown. Anticipating further experimental studies on it, we report here predicted vibrational spectra, {NMR} chemical shifts, spin–spin coupling constants and quadrupole coupling constants as well as optical spectra at the level of single and double excitations. The population analysis is non-trivial. By direct numerical integration, a charge of roughly +1 is obtained for the central tungsten atom. The charge distribution is strongly delocalised but bonding regions are clearly seen. A considerable electric field gradient exists at the gold nuclei. Although the radial bonds are strong, the system is quite elastic. The {DFT} activation energy for rotating one hemisphere against the other one, at a D5h transition state, is only about 20 {kJ} mol1. The corresponding hu vibrational frequency is predicted to be slightly below 30 cm1.},

With such a basis set, seven density functionals were tested. In addition, the performance of 21 energy density functionals were computed from the density calculated with the statistical average of orbital potentials ({SAOP}). Among all the choices tested, the best density functional for core-electron binding energies of C to F turns out to be the combination of Perdew-Wang (1986) functional for exchange and the Perdew-Wang (1991) functional for correlation, confirming earlier studies based on contracted Gaussian-type orbitals. For this best functional, five Slater-type orbital basis sets were examined, ranging from polarized double-zeta quality to the largest set available in the {ADF} package. For the best functional with the best basis set, the average absolute deviation ({AAD}) of the calculated value from experiment is only 0.16eV. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Previous experiments and calculations disagree about the number of gold atoms nc where the transition to 3D structures occurs. We combine trapped ion electron diffraction and state of the art electronic structure calculations to resolve this puzzle and establish nc=12. It is shown that theoretical studies using traditional generalized gradient functionals are heavily biased towards 2D structures. For a correct prediction of the 2D-3D crossover point it is crucial to use density functionals yielding accurate jellium surface energies, such as the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria ({TPSS}) functional or the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional modified for solids ({PBEsol}). Further, spin-orbit effects have to be included, and large, flexible basis sets employed. This combined theoretical-experimental approach is promising for larger gold and other metal clusters.},

The latter are crucially important to explain the absorption behavior and hence the color of gold. A detailed analysis of the oscillator strengths allows us to trace back the origin of the optical transitions within a given energy range to certain regions in the Brillouin zone. The four examples highlight the importance of relativistic effects that show up in different energy regimes of the optical spectra.

When paired with an appropriate exchange functional, our nonlocal correlation model yields accurate interaction energies of weakly-bound complexes, not only near the energy minima but also far from equilibrium. Our model exhibits an outstanding precision at predicting equilibrium intermonomer separations in van der Waals complexes. It also gives accurate covalent bond lengths and atomization energies.

We suggest that the {MGGA}'s stronger tendency toward 3D structures arises from their smaller gradient enhancement.

The pseudopotential core includes 92 electrons corresponding to the configuration [Xe]4f(14)5d(10)5f(14). The parameters for the elements 111-118 were fitted by two-component multi-configuration Hartree-Fock calculations in the intermediate coupling scheme to the total energies of 267 up to 797 J levels arising from 31 up to 62 nonrelativistic configurations, including also anionic and highly ionized states, with mean absolute errors clearly below 0.02 {eV} for averages corresponding to nonrelativistic configurations. Primitive basis sets for one- and two-component pseudopotential calculations have been optimized for the ground and excited states and exhibit finite basis set errors with respect to the finite-difference Hartree-Fock limit below 0.01 and 0.02 {eV}, respectively. General contraction schemes have been applied to obtain valence basis sets of polarized valence double- to quadruple-zeta quality. Results of atomic test calculations in the intermediate coupling scheme at the Fock-space coupled-cluster level are in good agreement with those of corresponding fully relativistic all-electron calculations based on the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate besides the well-known need of a relativistic treatment at the Dirac-Coulomb level also the necessity to include higher-order corrections for the superheavy elements.},

	abstract = {A systematic search for global and energetically low-lying minimum structures of neutral gold clusters Au(n) (n=2-20) is performed within a seeded genetic algorithm technique using density functional theory together with a relativistic pseudopotential. Choosing the energetically lowest lying structures we obtain electronic properties by applying a larger basis set within an energy-consistent relativistic small-core pseudopotential approach. The possibility of extrapolating these properties to the bulk limit for such small cluster sizes is discussed. In contrast to previous calculations on cesium clusters [B. Assadollahzadeh et al., Phys. Rev. B 78, 245423 (2008)] we find a rather slow convergence of any of the properties toward the bulk limit. As a result, we cannot predict the onset of metallic character with increasing cluster size, and much larger clusters need to be considered to obtain any useful information about the bulk limit. Our calculated properties show a large odd-even cluster size oscillation in agreement, for example, with experimental ionization potentials and electron affinities. For the calculated polarizabilities we find a clear transition to lower values at Au14, the first cluster size where the predicted global minimum clearly shows a compact three-dimensional (3D) structure. Hence, the measurement of cluster polarizabilities is ideal to identify the 2D--{\textgreater}3D transition at low temperatures for gold. Our genetic algorithm confirms the pyramidal structure for Au20.},

	abstract = {The energy band structure of gold is calculated by the relativistic augmented-plane-wave ({RAPW}) method. A nonrelativistic calculation is also presented, and a comparison between this and the {RAPW} results demonstrates that the shifts and splittings due to relativistic effects are of the same order of magnitude as the gaps (approximately 1 {eV}). Various integrated functions, density of states, joint density of states, and energy distributions of joint density of states are derived from the {RAPW} calculation. These functions are used in an interpretation of photoemission and static reflectance measurements. It is shown that the photoemission results are extremely well described in terms of a model assuming all transitions to be direct whereas a nondirect model fails. The ε2 profile calculated in a crude model assuming constant matrix elements matches well the corresponding experimental results. The calculated interband edge (ℏωi=2.38 {eV}) agrees with experimental values, and the absorption tail below the interband edge which is found in experimental traces is also contained in the theoretical curve. By means of a calculation of the Fermi surface and the constant-energy-difference surfaces it has been possible to trace out the regions in k⃗ space where the edge and tail transitions occur. It is demonstrated that structure in the static reflection curves are not related to critical points in the band structure. The arguments are supported by calculations of temperature shifts of the critical-point energies and comparison to the observed temperature shifts of the elements of structure in the experimental ε2 function. Such structure may originate in extended rather than localized regions of k⃗ space. In contrast, critical-point transitions show up clearly in modulated reflectance spectra, and all elements of structure are fully accounted for by our band model. The temperature and strain responses in the band structure are determined by performing the {RAPW} calculation with two lattice constants and estimating the effects of the lattice vibrations by means of an {OPW}-{LCAO} (linear combination of atomic orbitals) scheme with pseudopotential Fourier constants reduced by the appropriate Debye-Waller factors. The phonon spectrum has been calculated for the latter purpose.},

Density functional theory predicts a planar D2h structure for Au10 in contrast to recent second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory calculations, which predict a 3D C2v arrangement. The validity of the use of single-reference second-order Møller-Plesset theory for near metallic systems remains, however, questionable. On the other hand, it is less than clear how well density functional approximations perform for such clusters. We, therefore, decided to carry out quantum chemical calculations for Au10 using a variety of different density functionals as well as wavefunction-based methods including coupled cluster theory to compare the different energetically low lying 2D and 3D cluster isomers. The results are perhaps not encouraging showing that most computational methods do not predict correctly the energetic sequence of isomers compared to coupled cluster theory. As perturbative triple corrections in the coupled cluster treatment change the order in cluster stability, the onset of 2D to 3D transition in these gold clusters remains elusive. As expected, second-order Møller-Plesset theory is not suitable for correctly describing such systems.},

Our computations support the experimental observation that the relative stability of the monohalides increases from the fluoride toward the iodide, while the stability trend of the trihalides is the opposite. The potential energy surface ({PES}) of all gold trihalides has been investigated. These molecules are typical Jahn-Teller systems; the trigonal planar D3h-symmetry geometry does not correspond to the minimum energy structure for any of them. At the same time, the amount and character of their Jahn-Teller distortion changes gradually from {AuF}3 to {AuI}3. The minimum energy geometry is a T-shaped structure for {AuF}3 and {AuCl}3, with a Y-shaped transition-state structure. For {AuI}3, the Y-shaped structure lies lower than the T-shaped structure on the {PES}. For {AuBr}3 and {AuI}3, neither of them is the global minimum but instead an L-shaped structure, which lies outside the Jahn-Teller {PES}. This structure can be considered to be a donor-acceptor system, or a closed-shell interaction, with I2 acting as donor and {AuI} as acceptor. The dimers of gold monohalides have very short gold-gold distances and demonstrate the aurophilic interaction. The dimers of the trihalides are planar molecules with two bridging halogen atoms.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous formation of locally ordered patterns during dewetting of thin films on homogeneous and heterogeneous substrates is investigated based on the 3-D nonlinear equation of motion. Physicochemical heterogeneities engender the rapid formation of the primary holes that serve as "seeds" for the formation of locally ordered structures. The secondary multiring structure surrounding the primary hole evolves by one of the following two different pathways depending on the film thickness vis-à-vis the location of the minimum in the spinodal curve: (A) Thick films evolve by the formation of secondary satellite holes that originate from a ring-like depression behind the rim of the primary hole. The process of ordering is repeated until the true spinodal holes appear on the remaining substrate. (B) Ordering in a relatively thin film occurs by the formation of droplets caused by the disintegration of the elevated rim that surrounds the primary hole. The radial distance between the successive ordered layers is close to the spinodal length scale, lambda(m). Droplets within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly greater than lambda(m), whereas holes within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly less than lambda(m). The number density of holes or droplets in the ordered pattern is of the same order as the predictions of the spinodal theory. The number of ordered layers and the size of the locally ordered domain depend significantly on the relative magnitudes of the time scales for the following events: (1) formation of the primary hole, (2) growth of holes (inverse of hole-growth velocity), (3) formation of a secondary feature (hole or droplet) adjacent to the primary hole, (4) true spinodal rupture far from the primary hole. The morphology of an ordered structure can therefore be tailored by modulation of the film thickness and the short- and long-range intermolecular interactions (substrate surface properties), since these affect the time scales 1 to 4 in different ways.},

Using a force field developed recently for sp2 carbon atoms, we predict here the crystal structures and cohesive energies for close-packed crystals of C60 and C70. We predict, and confirm from calculations, that for C60 face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) packing is more stable than hexagonal close-packing (h.c.p.), by 0.90 kcal mol-1, whereas for C70 h.c.p. is more stable than f.c.c. by 0.35 kcal mol-1. The cubic structure of C60 undergoes an orthorhombic distortion to space group Cmca at 0 K. At higher temperatures there is rapid reorientation (but not free rotation) of C60 molecules, suggesting that above about 200 K a phase transition occurs to an orientationally disordered, f.c.c. structure (with a room-temperature lattice parameter of 14.13 angstrom). This may correspond to the first-order transition observed 4 at 249 K. The threefold axes of the C60 molecules in the low-temperature structure are not aligned with the threefold crystallographic axes.},

	abstract = {We characterize the molecular reorientational dynamics in two phases of solid C60 with "C {NMR} measurements. A change in the nature of the dynamics, indicated by a change in kinetic parameters ex-tracted from spin-lattice relaxation data, occurs at the phase transition at 260 K. Above the transition, the molecules appear to execute continuous rotational diffusion; below the transition, they appear to jump between symmetry-equivalent orientations. This interpretation is consistent with the x-ray-diffraction results of Heiney et al. as well as our {NMR} relaxation and spectral data. {PACS} numbers: 64.70.Kb, 33.25.Bn, 33.25.Dq, 61.50. — f The recent demonstration of a method [1] for produc-ing large quantities of solid C60 (buckminsterfullerene) has catalyzed an explosion of interest in the chemical and physical properties of this new molecular form of carbon. A variety of spectroscopic [2-7] and diffraction [8] mea-surements have confirmed the predicted truncated icosa-hedral (soccer ball) structure [9] of the C60 molecule. Even more recently, interest in the physical properties of Cqp in the solid state has received impetus from the discovery that C\&0 becomes a conductor [10] and a super-conductor [11]upon doping with alkali-metal atoms. Pure Ct,p adopts a crystal structure in which C6p mole-cules are positioned with their centers of mass on an fcc lattice [12]. ' C nuclear-magnetic-resonance ({NMR}) spectra of solid C6p have shown unequivocally that indivi-dual C\&p molecules reorient rapidly and isotropically in the solid state at room temperature [5,6, 13]. This reori-entational motion shows up as orientational disorder in room-temperature x-ray-diffraction measurements [12, 14]. As expected, the {NMR} spectra show that the motion becomes very slow at low temperatures; i.e. , large-amplitude reorientations of C6p molecules become infrequent on the time scale of the {NMR} measurements. These observations lead to an important question regard-ing the structure of solid C6p at low temperatures: Do C\&p molecules order orientationally or do they form an orientational glass? One might predict an orientationally disordered (glass) structure simply because it is not im-mediately obvious how icosahedral molecules would order orientationally on an fcc lattice. Surprisingly, a recent x-ray-diffraction and calorimetry study by Heiney et al. [14] has revealed a phase transition at about 250 K in solid C\&p that they interpret as a transition to an orienta-tionally ordered low-temperature structure. This inter-pretation is particularly remarkable because the earlier {NMR} studies showed that rapid reorientations persist well below the reported transition temperature. In this Letter, we present ' C {NMR} measurements that elucidate the nature of the molecular dynamics in both phases of solid C6p.

	abstract = {{BULK} C60 (fullerite) is a solid composed of extremely hard pseudospherical molecules bonded by weak van der Waals interactions. We expect that pressurization will probe this diversity as the intermolecular distance is reduced. Here we present experimental measurements of the room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state of C60 fullerite to pressures of 20 {GPa}. The face-centred cubic phase remains stable under hydrostatic compression to this pressure, with an atmospheric-pressure isothermal bulk modulus of K0 = 18.1 +/- 1.8 {GPa} and {dK}0/{dP} = 5.7 +/- 0.6, characteristic of isotropic van der Waals intermolecular bonding. X-ray diffraction intensity changes are consistent with the compressibility of the C60 molecule being significantly lower than that of the bulk fullerite solid. Under non-hydrostatic compression, a transition to a crystallographic structure of lower symmetry is observed at 16 +/- 1 {GPa}.},

The initial electrostatic potential map is well fit by a regular icosahedron of C atoms but with an average rotational disorder corresponding to Fm3m symmetry. The static appearance of this directly determined map, however, does not refute the notion of uncorrelated molecular positions in the crystal lattice, indicated earlier by nuclear-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and neutron scattering. Although the direct determination of crystallographic phases is correct, the occurrence of strong axial h00 reflections in the electron diffraction patterns appears to be a result of secondary scattering. Correction for this perturbation produces a good fit of the intensities to an isotropic spherical shell of C atoms. In fact, the static appearance of the initial potential map is artificial, owing to the use of only a limited set of phased structure factors in the Fourier transform carried out after the ab initio structure analysis.},

The resolution of the experimental setup allows to examine the volume decrease {dV}/dp under pressure even for pressures of a tenth of a {GPa}. The obtained data of numerous experimental runs result in a bulk modulus of 13.4 {GPa}, which is much smaller than the value reported by Duclos et al. [1]. At 170 K and 70 K a bulk modulus of 14.2 {GPa} and 14.7 {GPa} was obtained, respectively. The pressure induced fcc-sc transition at 300 K was clearly visible at approx. 0.3 {GPa} with a jump in the lattice parameter of 0.05 \{{\textbackslash}{AA}\}. With increasing pressure we found an extreme change in {dV}/dp, which disables the usage of common equations of state ({EOS}), like the Murnaghan [2] or Birch [3] equation. Considering the small compressibility of the fullerence molecules we suggest a modified {EOS} to describe the experimental data.},

For an accurate description, atom-pairwise dispersion-corrected density functional theory ({DFT}-D) was applied. The {DFT}-D3 scheme was extended non-empirically to improve the description of Ti atoms in bulk systems. New dispersion coefficients were derived from {TDDFT} calculations for electrostatically embedded {TiO}(2) clusters. The dispersion coefficient [Formula: see text] is reduced by a factor of 18 compared to the free atom. The three {TiO}(2) modifications were optimized in periodic plane-wave calculations with dispersion-corrected {GGA} ({PBE}, {revPBE}) and hybrid density functionals ({PBE}0, {revPBE}0). The calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with experimental data, in particular the dispersion-corrected {PBE}0 and {revPBE}0 hybrid functionals. Although the observed relative stabilities could not be reproduced in all cases, dispersion corrections improve the results. For an accurate description of bulk metal oxides, London dispersion is a prominent force that should not be neglected when energies and structures are computed with {DFT}. Additionally, the influence of dispersion interactions on the relaxation of the {TiO}(2)(110) surface is investigated.},

The complicated interplay of factors that determine the final results (preferred adsorption mode, the anchor’seffect on the dye’s electronic structure, and dye−semiconductor coupling) is illustrated through a few examples showing how chemical intuition can often be misleading in this problem.},

	abstract = {The attachment chemistry of the chromophore onto the semiconductor surface influences the efficiency of electron injection in dye-sensitized solar cells ({DSSCs}). In this work, we study injection times for dyes that bind to the semiconductor surface via the phosphonic acid anchoring group and the effect on the injection time of different binding modes (molecular or dissociative, monodentate or bidentate) of phosphonic acid for both {TiO}2 rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces. We calculate electron injection times for a large set of organic dyes on {TiO}2 rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces for the most stable adsorption geometries of the phosphonic acid anchoring group, using a model based on partitioning the semiconductor? chromophore system into fragments. We analyze the influence of the size and nature of the anchoring group on the injection times, performing calculations with larger models of the anchoring group (e.g., phenyl-phosphonic acid). Through the partitioning procedure, we are able to separate the effect of the binding geometry from other effects influencing the efficiency of the electron injection. The results show that dissociative bidentate adsorption modes generally lead to faster injection, compared to monodentate and molecular ones, similar to the results obtained earlier for analogous carboxylated dyes. Our results are in good agreement with experiments (where available), showing that our model is capable of predicting the effects of the anchoring groups and of different spacer groups on the injection times and is therefore suitable for designing new and more efficient chromophores.},

	abstract = {The optimal adsorption modes for the amino acids glycine and proline on the ideal {TiO}(2)(110) surface are investigated by using density functional theory ({PBE}) applying periodic boundary conditions. Binding modes with anionic acid moieties bridging two titanium atoms after transferring a proton to the surface are the most stable configurations for both molecules investigated-similar to previous results for carboxylic acids. In contrast to the latter compounds, amino acids can form hydrogen bonds via the amino group towards the surface-bound proton; this provides an additional stabilisation of 15-20 {kJ} mol(-1). Zwitterionic binding modes are less stable (by 10-20 {kJ} mol(-1)) and are less important for proline. Neutral modes are energetically even less favourable. Calculations of vibrational frequencies and core-level shifts complement the adsorption study and provide guidance for future experimental investigations. Control of the computational parameters is crucial for the derivation of accurate results. The layout and thickness of the slab model used are also shown to be decisive factors. Calculations with a different {GGA}-functional ({PW}91) provide very similar relative energies, although the absolute energies change by about 20 {kJ} mol(-1). Results derived with the hybrid functional {PBE}0 show an even greater stabilisation of the anionic binding modes with respect to the zwitterionic modes. A previously observed discrepancy between experimental and theoretical results for glycine could be solved, although the experimentally proposed free rotation of the C-C bond could not be reproduced.},

	abstract = {The fast development of new organic sensitizers leads to the need for a better understanding of the complexity and significance of their adsorption processes on {TiO}(2) surfaces. We have investigated a prototype of the triphenylamine-cyanoacrylic acid (donor-acceptor) on rutile {TiO}(2) (110) surface with special attention on the monolayer region. This molecule belongs to the type of dye, some of which so far has delivered the record efficiency of 10\%-10.3\% for pure organic sensitizers [W. Zeng, Y. Cao, Y. Bai, Y. Wang, Y. Shi, M. Zhang, F. Wang, C. Pan, and P. Wang, Chem. Mater. 22, 1915 (2010)]. The molecular configuration of this dye on the {TiO}(2) surface was found to vary with coverage and adopt gradually an upright geometry, as determined from near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Due to the molecular interaction within the increasingly dense packed layer, the molecular electronic structure changes systematically: all energy levels shift to higher binding energies, as shown by photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the investigation of charge delocalization within the molecule was carried out by means of resonant photoelectron spectroscopy. A fast delocalization (∼1.8 fs) occurs at the donor part while a competing process between delocalization and localization takes place at the acceptor part. This depicts the "push-pull" concept in donor-acceptor molecular system in time scale.},

Our study focuses on determining the lowest energy adsorption mode and discussing the electronic properties of the resultant hybrid interface by means of density functional theory ({DFT}) calculations using the hybrid exchange (B3LYP) functional. We find that both molecules adsorb dissociatively at the {TiO}(2) surface giving a type {II} (staggered) heterojunction. Compared to isonicotinic acid, catechol, due to the greater hybridisation of its molecular orbitals with the states of the substrate, is seen to enhance performance when employed as an anchoring group in dye sensitised solar cells.},

Our calculations clearly show that the non-dissociative bidentate adsorption is more stable than the dissociative one for the aliphatic diol, both at low and high coverage conditions, result far differently from many other chemical anchor cases for which the dissociative mechanism usually prevails. On the other hand, for catechol the dissociative bidentate is the most stable at low coverage conditions, whereas, surprisingly, increasing the coverage with catechol makes the non-dissociative mechanism the most stable one, revealing possible coexistence of a dissociative and non-dissociative anchoring at high coverage. This work unraveled a variety of adsorption fashions of the diol compounds in conjunction with the impact of the coverage effect, highly dependent on the nature of the lateral chain of the anchor group.},

	abstract = {Anatase {TiO}(2) is a widely used photocatalytic material, and catechol (1,2-benzendiol) is a model organic sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells. The growth and the organization of a catecholate monolayer on the anatase (101) surface were investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Isolated molecules adsorb preferentially at steps. On anatase terraces, monodentate ('D1') and bidentate ('D2') conformations are both present in the dilute limit, and frequent interconversions can take place between these two species. A D1 catechol is mobile at room temperature and can explore the most favorable surface adsorption sites, whereas D2 is essentially immobile. When a D1 molecule arrives in proximity of another adsorbed catechol in an adjacent row, it is energetically convenient for them to pair up in nearest-neighbor positions taking a D2-D2 or D2-D1 configuration. This intermolecular interaction, which is largely substrate mediated, causes the formation of one-dimensional catecholate islands that can change in shape but are stable to break-up. The change between D1 and D2 conformations drives both the dynamics and the energetics of this model system and is possibly of importance in the functionalization of dye-sensitized solar cells.},

Six exchange–correlation functionals were used to evaluate the structural and elastic properties of {TiO}2. The calculated bulk and shear moduli of {TiO}2 confirm that the cotunnite and fluorite phases are not as hard as traditional ultrahard materials, such as diamond. The predicted phonon spectra of the cubic phases of {TiO}2, i.e., the fluorite and pyrite phases, show that they are dynamically unstable at ambient conditions. However, the fluorite structure can be stabilized as a metastable phase at high pressures. The pressure-induced phase transitions of {TiO}2 are found to depend on the starting material. The predicted pressure-induced phase transition pressures and sequence are consistent with previous experimental and theoretical studies. From the calculated Gibbs energies, we investigated the pressure–temperature phase diagram of {TiO}2. The calculated phase equilibria are in good agreement with the available experimental results. The currently predicted phase diagram is expected to provide helpful guidance for the future synthesis of high-pressure phases in {TiO}2.},

	abstract = {We present a Density Functional Theory investigation aimed to model the possible adsorption modes to the {TiO}(2) surface of two representative {TPA}-based dyes, termed L0 and rh-L0, having the two mostly employed anchoring groups, namely the cyanoacrylic and rhodanine-3-acetic acids respectively. The bidentate coordination with proton transfer to a nearby surface oxygen is found to be the energetically favored anchoring mode for both dyes. The calculations show that the different dye anchoring groups give rise to a very different electronic coupling between the dye and the manifold of unoccupied semiconductor states, thus implying different electron injection mechanisms. The strongly coupled L0 dye possibly shows an adiabatic electron injection mechanism, while a non-adiabatic electron injection can be foreseen for the weakly coupled rh-L0 dye. The different orientation with respect to the {TiO}(2) surface for the two classes of dyes, implying different distances of the donor group from the oxide surface, together with the different electron injection mechanisms might account for the faster recombination reaction measured for the rhodanine-based dyes.},

Quantities investigated were atomization energies, dipole moments and structure parameters for Hartree-Fock, density functional theory and correlated methods, for which we had chosen Møller-Plesset perturbation theory as an example. Finally recommendations are given which type of basis set is used best for a certain level of theory and a desired quality of results.},

	abstract = {A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum energy pathways ({MEPs}) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a {MEP}. We compare the nudged elastic band ({NEB}), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the {NEB} and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding {MEPs} when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the {MEP} with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate {MEP} is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on {MgO}(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).},

	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3382344},
	doi = {10.1063/1.3382344},
	abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory ({DFT}-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a {DFT}-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers ({CN}). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%-40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) {DFT}-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised {DFT}-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with {DFT} and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},
